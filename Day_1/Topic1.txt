Topic 1: XPath – Basics & Syntax
Subtopic a: XPath Expressions – Absolute vs. Relative XPath
=========================================================================
🔹 What is XPath?
XPath (XML Path Language) is used in Selenium to navigate through HTML elements using a path-based approach.

✅ Types of XPath:
1️⃣ Absolute XPath – Starts from the root (/) and defines the full path.
2️⃣ Relative XPath – Starts from anywhere (//) and is more flexible.

📌 Example:

html
<div>
   <form>
      <input id="username" type="text" name="user">
   </form>
</div>

✅ Absolute XPath:

xpath

/html/body/div/form/input
🔴 Not recommended because any small change in the structure will break the XPath.

✅ Relative XPath:
xpath
Copy
Edit
//input[@id='username']
🟢 Recommended because it is shorter and more reliable.


Subtopic b: Common XPath Functions
=============================================================================================
1️⃣ contains() – Partial Matching
✅ Example: Find a button with text containing "Login"

xpath
//button[contains(text(),'Login')]
✅ Example: Find an element where class contains "submit"

xpath
//div[contains(@class, 'submit')]
2️⃣ text() – Match Exact Text
✅ Example: Find a link with exact text "Click Here"

xpath
//a[text()='Click Here']
3️⃣ and / or – Multiple Conditions
✅ Example: Find an input field with type text and name user

xpath
//input[@type='text' and @name='user']
✅ Example: Find an element with either class "btn" or "submit"

xpath
//button[@class='btn' or @class='submit']
